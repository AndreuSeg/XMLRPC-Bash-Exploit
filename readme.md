Bash fruteforce for wordpress xmlrpc.php file

The xmlrpc.php file is a WordPress file that allows communication between the website and external applications using the XML-RPC protocol.
This file is used by many WordPress plugins and mobile apps to interact with the website and perform various tasks such as posting content, updating the site, and getting information.
However, this file can also be abused by malicious attackers to brute force and discover valid site user credentials. This is because xmlrpc.php allows attackers to make an unlimited number of login requests without being blocked, making it relatively easy to execute a brute force attack.
